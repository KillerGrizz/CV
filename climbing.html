    Hey There, I'm Josh. I've been bouldering for the past few weeks and I've fallen in love with the sport. While I don't know how long this affair will last, I thought blogging about my experience would serve as the perfect project to help
     with one of my other passions - programmin, and provide me with a fun project. Also it might help me solidify what i've been learning along the way.
      So, whether you're new to climbing, or have been at it much longer than me, I hope you enjoy the lessons and struggles of my journey as a climber! -Josh
